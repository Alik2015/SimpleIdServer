`test` realm is now ready to be used. there are two OPENID configurations endpoints :
* master : [https://localhost:5001/master/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://localhost:5001/master/.well-known/openid-configuration).
* test: [https://localhost:5001/test/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://localhost:5001/test/.well-known/openid-configuration).

You can authenticate to both `realm` separately with the same `administrator` user.
* Browse the URL [https://localhost:5001/master](https://localhost:5001/master), authenticate as an administrator : login : `administrator`, password : `password`.
* Browse the URL [https://localhost:5001/test](https://localhost:5001/test), authenticate with the same credentials.

The user has two active sessions in two different `realm`.
